The goals of Dev Brunch are:

- provide a **casual**, low-key space for developers to socialize
- build confidence in **novice** developers to get involved in the community
- connect aspiring developers with peers and mentors
- serve as an alternative to primarily evening-time, presentation-focused user groups

None of this is meant to disparrage existing user groups - in fact, we hope to
be a stepping stone for many new developers into those user groups. Similarly,
we've found that not only are existing user groups already very
newbie-friendly, but are often attended by users just embarking on this crazy
journey of programming.

But every little bit helps, and sometimes people could use an extra shot of
"you are welcome here", which is why we wanted to create a special space where
people would be less likely to suffer the age-old "impostor syndrome".

All of this is still in development. If you have ideas about how to achieve
these goals, or would even like to get involved in the project, just say
